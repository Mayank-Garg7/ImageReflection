This is a simple web page that displays an image gallery consisting of five images. The web page is created using HTML and styled with CSS. Each image is contained within a separate box for a visually appealing presentation.

## Features

1. **Image Gallery:** The web page displays a gallery of images, providing a visual showcase of your content.

2. **Responsive Design:** The gallery is designed to be responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

3. **Custom Styling:** You can easily customize the appearance of the gallery by modifying the CSS in the "style.css" file. Adjust the colors, sizes, and layout to match your preferences.

## How to Use

1. **Image Boxes:** The images are displayed within separate image boxes. Each box is identified using a class (`ib1`, `ib2`, `center`, `ib3`, `ib4`) for custom styling if needed.

2. **Image Source:** Replace the `src` attribute of each `<img>` tag with the file path or URL of your desired images.

## Example Usage

1. To replace an image, locate the `<img>` tag within the corresponding image box (`ib1`, `ib2`, `center`, `ib3`, `ib4`) and update the `src` attribute with the new image file path or URL.

2. Customize the styling of the image boxes by modifying the CSS in the "style.css" file.
